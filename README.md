## AppStore Description

Î” This is you.

Have you got both the skill to avoid touching the obstacles and the concentration to solve the tasks and find the correct answer?

Gravitational is a whole new gaming experience combining arcade game elements with brain challenging mental maths. It requires both skill and concentration at the same time. 

Math has never been this much fun.

*Please note that Gravitational is a free download supported by small ad banners. Gravitational has been crafted by a young developer in his free time, so if you wish to support the developer, feel free to get the advertisement-free version via in-app purchase.
